# GameStore_FullStack

This project is a mock Online Game Store developed as a full-stack web application. The backend is built using Express.js to serve as a REST API server with MVC pattern, while the frontend is developed with the React framework, functioning as a SPA (Single Page Application) and MySQL for data storage.

- Guest: 
    A Guest is an unregistered user who can browse all available games displayed on the main page and the games page.

- User: 
    A User has all the permissions of a Guest, with the additional ability to manage a personal shopping cart. The User can add games to the cart for future purchase.
